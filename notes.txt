DHCP Option Sets:
+ Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a standard for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network
+ DHCP options sets are associated with your AWS account so that you can use them across all of your VPCs

AWS Limits
+ 5 Elastic IP addresses per region
+ Security Groups:
  + Up to 50 inbound and 50 outbound rules for each SG
  + Up to 5 SGs can be assigned to each network interface


Establish a VPN connection
+ Establish VPG at VPC side
+ Establish CGW at customer side
+ Initiate traffic from CGW to VPG
+ If CGW support BGP than dynamic routing, otherwise static


EC2:
+ Autoscaling
  + CLI: aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name myASG --launch-configuraiton-name myLC --availability-zones us-east-1a, us-east-1c --min-size 1 --max-size 10 --desired-capacity 3 --load-balancer-names myELB
  + Auto-scaling plans: Maintain Current Instant Levels, Manual Scaling, Scheduled Scaling, Dynamic Scaling
+ ELB
  + Provides a single CNAME entry point for DNS
    + supports health checks - status: InService or OutOfService


Policies - defines one or more permission; and each permission defines	
+ Effect: allow/deny
  + Service: aws cloud service
  + Resource: ARN (arn:aws:service:region:account-id:resourcetype:resource)
  + Action: e.g. Read* 
  + Condition (optional): e.g. IP address range; or time interval
  + Example:
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",

      }
    }


RDS

+ API: CreateDBInstance, ModifyDBInstance
+ DB Parameter Groups: manage features and common configurations
    + Change of parameter group requires reboot
    + Fail-over: DNS name unchanged, and CNAME points to standby
    + Multi-AZ deployments are for DR only
    + Performance: use read replicas
    + Scaling out:
        + Shards (partitioning or sharding --> DynamoDb or Cassandra);
        + or use read relpicas -> asnynchronous

DynamoDB metrics:
  + CloudWatch metrics: 
    + ConsumedReadCapacityUnits

SQS Operations:
+ CreateQueue
+ List Queue
+ DeleteQueue
+ SendMessage
+ ListDeadLetterSourceQueues
+ Long Polling: WaitTimeSeconds 
+ Limits:
  + Maximum of 120,000 inflight messages per queue
  + Maximum visibility timeout for a message is 12 hours; default is 30 seconds
  + The minimum message size is 1 KB. The maximum is 256 KB

SWF - Domains:
+ Domain
  + Domains provide a way of scoping Amazon SWF resources within your AWS account.
  + It is possible to have more than one workflow in a domain; however, workflows in different domains cannot interact with each other
+ Limits
  + 100 domains
  + Maximum open workflow executions – 100,000 per domain
  + Maximum workflow execution time – 1 year
  + Maximum request size – 1 MB per request
  + Workflow retention time limit – 90 days

SNS
+ Limits: 100,000 Topics

Route53:
  + SOA (Start of Authority Record): is mandatory in all zone file
  + A Records is used to map a host to an IPv4 IP address
  + AAAA records map a host to an IPv6 address
  + MX (Mail Exchange): points to a host defined by an A or AAAA record 
  + NS (Name server)
    + used by TLD server to redirect traffic to the DNS server that contains the authorative DNS record
  + PTR (pointer): reverse of an A record (maps IP to a DNS name)
  + CNAME you cannot create a CNAME for a Zone Apex
  + Alias: Difference to CNAME: they are not visible to resolvers. 
      + Alias is recommended for S3 mapping
  + SPF (Secondary Policy Framework): used by mail servers to combat spam
  + Limits
    + 50 Domains per account
    + 50 Health checks
