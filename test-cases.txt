1st TEST SCENARIO - EC2 instance with public IP address:
a) start one instance, stop it
b) restart it and check ip addresses
RESULT:
kept private IP
issued new public IP - 52.62.38.40 
--------------------------------------------------------------
2nd TEST SCENARIO - two EC2 instance with public IP addresses:
a) launch instance, stop it; 
b) start new instance; terminate it 
c)re-start first instance.
RESULTS:
a) 
public IP:  13.236.179.237
private IP: 172.31.6.39
b) 
public IP:  13.211.203.155
private IP: 172.31.13.112
c)
public IP:  52.65.179.0
private IP: 172.31.6.39

LESSON LEARNT: 
a stopped instance does not keep it's IP instance after a restart
--------------------------------------------------------------
3rd TEST SCENARIO - EIP
a) launch an EC2 instance 
b) attach an EIP to it afterwards
RESULTS:
a) private IP: 10.0.1.17
b) 
CLI command: aws ec2 allocate-address --domain "vpc" --region ap-southeast-2
EIP: 13.236.53.34 --> associate to instance
Optional: Allow Elastic IP to be reassociated if already attached (currently - to a different instance)
warning: If you associate an Elastic IP address with your instance, your current public IP address is released
CLI command: aws ec2 associate-address --allocation-id "eipalloc-0ea7cfc2629eff1d7" --instance-id "i-0718b4bae74f8a3f4" --no-allow-reassociation --private-ip-address "10.0.1.17" --region ap-southeast-2
--------------------------------------------------------------
4th TEST SCENARIO - RE-ASSOCIATE EIP:
a) start new instance in different VPC
RESULT:
EIP can be re-associated - even to an instance in a different VPC
-> dont' forget to release your EIP - otherwise you will be charged
--------------------------------------------------------------
